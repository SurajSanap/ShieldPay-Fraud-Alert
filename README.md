# Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection Project

This project focuses on developing a Credit Card Fraud Transaction Detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, helping businesses and individuals prevent financial losses.

## Files Included

1. `fraud_transaction_detection_handling_imbalance(1).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and documentation for the project. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. `templates/`: This directory contains the HTML templates used for the web application.

3. `app.py`: Python script implementing the web application using the Flask framework. It provides an interface for users to interact with the fraud detection system.

4. `LICENSE`: The license file for this project.

## Project Overview

The `fraud_transaction_detection_handling_imbalance(1).ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, detailing the various stages involved in building the fraud transaction detection system. It includes the following sections:

1. Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the dataset through visualizations and gaining insights into the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to enhance the model's ability to detect fraud.

4. Model Training: Building and training a machine learning model using supervised learning techniques.

5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.

## Web Application

The `app.py` script implements a web application using the Flask framework. It serves as an interface for users to interact with the fraud detection system. The application allows users to input transaction details and receive real-time predictions on whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

To run the web application, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
